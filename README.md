This project never hosted code, it was simply used as a issue / task tracker during the development and initial deployment of the Fedora / CentOS FAS2 replacement, which ened up being called Fedora Accounts / CentOS Accounts.

The individual pieces of what makes up Fedora Accounts are:

* [noggin](https://github.com/fedora-infra/noggin) (the web UI for Fedora Accounts)
* [freeipa-fas](https://github.com/fedora-infra/freeipa-fas) (the freeIPA plugin adding extra things Fedora Accounts needs)
* [fasjson](https://github.com/fedora-infra/fasjson) (the JSON API for Fedora Accounts)
* [fedora-accounts-docs](https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-accounts-docs) (User documentation for Fedora Accounts)

The team that developed Fedora Accounts also used a github board to organize issues across this tracker and the above projects, it is also archived here:
